# TheLazyTraveler
What is the problem? 

Organizing and planning a vacation is very difficult. You have to think about flights, car rentals, locations, prices, and many more things to make your vacation everything you want it to be. Some people enjoy planning those types of things, but there are some people who don’t like that aspect of vacationing. We want to solve that problem by creating a website that will do all of the vacation planning for you. All you have to do is tell us where you want to go and how much you want to spend. This website will alleviate the stress of looking up available hotels, activities in the area to do, foods to try, and other things of that nature that a lazy traveler wouldn’t want to handle.  

Why is the problem important to solve?

Have you ever wanted to go on a vacation but didn’t know where to start? Is researching trips daunting and hiring a travel agent undesirable? Well we have a solution that solves these problems and more! Planning your trip shouldn’t be a painful experience or more work than the work you’re trying to get a break from. Our application will ask you a few simple questions like what season you want to travel during and what your budget is and we will recommend several different options that fit your needs. This takes out a lot of the hassle involved in planning a vacation or trip. Additionally, instead of looking at photos posted by the hotel or city you are thinking about visiting you can view the authentic photos uploaded by other users. Once you get your list of recommendations, you can favorite them, go to your account and view past trips, and filter options. Furthermore, right before your trip we will send you an email with a weather update of the expected forecast during your trip. When travelling is easier more people will go out and see the world and tourism across the world will increase. Our application will make vacation planning easier and more enjoyable while still finding the best prices and giving plenty of options.
